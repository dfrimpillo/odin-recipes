    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>Eggs Benedict is a common American breakfast or brunch dish, consisting of two halves of an English muffin, each topped with Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. It was popularized in New York City. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>8 strips Canadian-style bacon</li>
        <li>4 English muffins, split</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep water at a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently slip egg into simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of water.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining eggs.</li>
        <li>Cook eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Brown bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Toast English muffins on a baking sheet under the preheated broiler.</li>
        <li>Spread toasted muffins with softened butter and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.</li>
